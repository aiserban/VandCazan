## Personalized car selling website for my VW Golf VI

(Available only in Romanian language, but you can use Google Translate to give you an idea of what it's all about)

### Why?
Because I liked my old car and had time to do a small side project.

I enjoyed working on a totally different project than what I have been working on in recent years:
- no deadlines, no teams, no managers, no other corporation processes
- no backend, no API, just a simple static website
- no JS frameworks, just some plain old vanilla javascript
- no code standards and complicated patterns, just some code that happens to work
- no build tools, just a manual minification of CSS and JS files
- no CSS frameworks, just some plain old CSS with ids and classes
- no unit tests, no integration tests
- no designers, just feedback from close friends
- no expectations, just a fun experiment on social media
- about an interesting topic for me

### Files
This repo contains the final unminified version of the website:
- HTML
- CSS: no bootstrap, not optimized, not high quality code
- JavaScript: no frameworks, no documentation, no code standards
- Images and statistics of my own personal car
- The minified public version available on [minified branch](https://github.com/micku7zu/golf6devanzare.ro/tree/minified) and obtained by manually minimizing the CSS and JS files.
